This is a daily sales projection for Pat's salmon cookies. I have calculated hourly totals for each store utilizing _helper functions and Math.random along with Pat's estimates of minimum and maximum customers and average cookies per customer. 
Each store is it's own object with multipe elements. Functions were created to calculate cookies sold per hour. These values were pushed into arrays and rendered to the index page.
