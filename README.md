# cookie-stand
This is a daily sales projection for Pat Family Cookie Stands. I have calculated hourly totals for each store utilizing _helper functions and Math.random along with Pat's estimates of minimum and maximum customers and average cookies per customer. 
Each store is it's own object with multipe elements. Functions were created to calculate cookies sold per hour. These values were pushed into arrays and rendered to the sales projection page. 
All images provided were used in the site. 

Code reviews helped quite a bit in seeing where I went wrong with some JS. Ed's advice helped with the NaNs I was getting. I used Jon Duckett's "HTML & CSS" book for help with table stylings and page layout. I also used some things I learned while doing paired programming with Merry, like "hr" lines.
